This directory contains source code and other resources for the examples in chapter 3.

The python files marked with an * are actual applications that may be started either by double clicking the file or by starting it from the command line by changin to this directory and issueing a command like 

c:\python32\python.exe application.py

This will start up a CherryPy webserver accessible on http://localhost:8080/ or http://127.0.0.1:8080/

All applications require the user to authenticate and are preconfigured to accept 'user' and 'secret' (both without the quotes) as valid credentials.

All applications require Python 3 and a properly installed CherryPy distribution. All neccessary jQuery libraries are provided in the static directory.
